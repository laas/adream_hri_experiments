# adream_hri_experiments
This package provides and record launch files, parameters, 3D models and other tools to run HRI experiments in the Adream environment, with the LAAS' RIS/HRI team tools.

## CONFIGURE

run `initialize_links.sh` to setup the symlinks in the p3d directory. You must have installed the move3d/assets prior to this ([see move3d doc](https://www.openrobots.org/wiki/move3d#P3D_Files)).

## Scope

Contributions are welcome by RIS/HRI members and associates. Keep in mind that contributions **must stay of generic use**, i.e. anyone else migth need this to use in their own experiments. It is not the place for any specific experiment setting (you were thinking in putting your `icraDemo2018.launch` here? Nope!)
